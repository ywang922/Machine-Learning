###  Credit Risk Resampling Final Questions

#### Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

   * ANSWER : 
   SMOTE Oversampling model had the best balanced accuracy score (0.9937) which is the highest compare to models (Combination Sampling:0.9935; Undersampling: 0.987; Naive Random Oversampling:    0.795 ; Simple Logistic Regression: 0.5)

#### Which model had the best recall score?

   * ANSWER : 
   Three models (Combination Sampling, Undersampling and SMOTE Oversampling) all have the same best recall score 0.99, that is the highest recall score. The other two models recall scores are    
   lower (Naive Random Oversampling:0.61 ; Simple Logistic Regression:0.97)


#### Which model had the best geometric mean score?

   * ANSWER : 
   Three models (Combination Sampling, Undersampling and SMOTE Oversampling) all have the same best geometric mean score 0.99, that's the highest geometric mean score. The other two models  
   geometric mean scores are lower (Naive Random Oversampling:0.77 ; Simple Logistic Regression:0.00)
